Hey! I'm Michal and I love creating **delicious and healthy desserts**.

Every recipe is **vegan by default**.

See tags for additional info (such as #sugar-free, #gluten-free, #raw, etc.)

When it comes to desserts, **I follow three principles**:

**1. Never follow a recipe**.

Substitute, experiment, make tweaks as you see fit. Every dessert prep is an opportunity to improve on the previous version.

**2. 50% of taste is in presentation**

Desserts are experiences, consumed not only with our mouths but also our eyes. Make sure you feed both.

**3. Get your hands dirty**

Always mix the dough with your hands, so you can feel the consistency or your dessert.

**Enjoy your Nomz!**
